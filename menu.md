  We're always trying new things so keep an eye out. We may also vary the menu depending on the seasons.
  Got a hankering for something? Want to see it on our menu? Get in touch, we can't promise anything but we'll do our best.
  NB Not all the pizza selection and other yummies on the menu are always sold during our markets or events, so if you fancy something in particular, please check with us.
  We do drinks at private events
