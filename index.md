hero-text: British-inspired Wood-Fired Pizza
intro-text: Born & Raised is a mobile wood-fired pizzeria. We create artisan British pizzas in our converted Land Rover Defender. Head chef Tom Dewey, who trained under Gary Rhodes, built Born & Raised on the concept of fine Italian pizza dough combined with responsibly sourced British ingredients.  We built an oven inside our Land Rover and took our creations to the streets of London. We cater for all manner of events and operate at a number of market locations around the city.
